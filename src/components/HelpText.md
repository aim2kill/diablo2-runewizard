## What is it?

The Runewizard lets you check easily what runewords you can make with the runes you have found.

Click on the runes to mark which ones you have found. The available runewords will be highlighted automatically.

The table can be sorted by clicking on Runeword, Runes, Item Types, or Level.

## Runes

The runes are listed in order of rarity, from top to bottom, and left to right. Each vertical group of rune represents roughly **Common**, **Semi-Rare**, and **Extremely Rare** runes. Note that the order is consistent with the [rune upgrade formulas](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/cube.shtml) for the Horadric Cube. For example: 3 x Tal = 1 x Ral rune.

## Runewords

Not all runewords Stats will be labeled in the same order as in-game.

## Note about storage

Your selection of runes is saved in the browser's _local storage_. Keep in mind that manually clearing your browser cache may reset the selected runes.
